# Web Dev 2 Final - Portfolio

I think the main challenge I had going into this project was figuring out bootstrap since from what I understood from the assignment rubric it sounded like we weren't allowed to use any regular coding and everything had to be made with bootstrap. Or at the very least, 90% of your final portfolio site had to be made with bootstrap. 

Either way, it's sort of the Dunning Kruger Quadrant where my knowledge was so rudimentary that so much of bootstrap fell into either "Known unknowns" and the "unknown unknowns" (see image: [quadrant](https://i0.wp.com/mentalhealthathome.org/wp-content/uploads/knowledge-window.png?resize=768%2C768&ssl=1)). Since our prior bootstrap activity and lecture didn't reallyyyyy do a complete job at imparting how bootstrap works. I think what I learned from that was that there's this framework that lets you build a site with code that has a generally nice look that's responsive right out of the box. And that the main thing is that instead of having to add a bunch of CSS customizations you can do most things by simply adding more bootstrap classes to whatever elements you're trying to customize. Which is handy, that's fine, however witht the class activity alone it's hard to see how applicable this actually is and how someone could actually go about making the standard items look completely differnet. 

Which is to say, when I started my project I felt that I was basically re-learning bootstap. And since what bootstrap actually HAD was in my unknown unknown knowedge, I ended up having to much more backtracking or attempts to debug then I expected (I wouldn't be surrpised if there's still lots of redundent code in my work now). Originally I added in a bunch of CSS for changing the margin, font weight and size etc until after hours of working on this that I somehow found out about the m, p, etc bootstrap classes. And then I had to go back in and change everythin around which was completely annoying.

I think my last gripe is with how confusing or un-intuitive the bootstrap documentaton is since on the bootstrap website it's mostly just a wall of text and no indication of the order each concept or idea should be read in/introduced. In the end it was various youtube videos that broke down bootstrap containers etc that actually helped me figure out how it actually worked. And I understand that once you're framiliar with the concept or pattern that it's acutally relatively simple. I dunno, maybe it's the interface, maybe I have mild deslexia or just coding specific deslexia, but I think the issue I have often is that it's often difficult to read code. So when I have to baktrack it's painful. Then again, could be an unknown unknown issue, because maybe VSC has a bunch of settings or plugins that make reading code easier like letting you dictate the line height, kerning, letter spacing etc.

Anyhow that's all to say, my main challenge is that figuring out bootstrap was mostly a uphill battle.
